## ADR == Architecture Decision Records

During meetings, it isn't unusual to make decisions that impact a product's architecture or operation.  While these decisions are frequently captured in the meeting minutes, it is time consuming and inefficient to wade through all the meeting minutes looking for those decisions.  Therefore, we will capture them using the [ADR template](./adr-template.md).

The ADR is a lightweight process for documenting these decisions. By storing them in the repository with the code, we will have a record and history.

The concept of ADRs orignated in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
