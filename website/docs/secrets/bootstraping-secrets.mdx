# Overview

When accessing to protected resources there is a need for a client to authenticate before
the access is granted and the resource is consumed. For the authentication, a client presents
credentials that are either created manually or available through infrastructure a common scenario
is a secrets store.

Weave gitops allows you to provision the secret management infrastructure as part of [its capabilities](./setup-secrets-operator.mdx).
However, in order to provision the secret infrastructure, as any other application that has secrets, we
need to make the secret it needs to install it.

This type of initial secret is what we call it bootstrapping secret and this guide gives you
with the different alternatives that weave gitops gives you to achieve the task.

Bootstrapping secrets will be not only present while provision your secrets managmenet solution but in
any platform provisioning task that comes before you have avaialble before the secrets management solution
is availabe. Another common example is provisioning platform capabilities itself via
https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/cluster-management/getting-started/#profiles-and-clusters
that are stored in private repositories. For example https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/helmreleases/#helm-repository-authentication-with-credentials

To address this problem, weave gitops provides the following alternatives:

- SecretSync CRD: to leverage weave gitops for secrets bootstrapping.
- SecretSync Terraform Module: to leverage terraform and t for secrets bootstrapping.

## Using `SecretSync` Custom Resource

`SecretSync` its a CRD to provides semantics to sync [Kuberentes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) from management cluster to leaf clusters.

An example could be seen below:

```yaml
apiVersion: capi.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: SecretSync
metadata:
  name: my-dev-secret-syncer
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: dev
  secretRef:
    name: my-dev-secret
  targetNamespace: my-namespace
```
Where you could find two main configuration sections:

1) Select the secret to sync:

```yaml
  secretRef:
    name: my-dev-secret
```

2) Select via labels the [GitopsClusters](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/)
that the secret will be synced to:

```yaml
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: dev
```

# Bootstrapping secrets to leaf cluster using terraform

## Requirements

- Working management cluster and a leaf cluster.
- [TF-Controller](./tf-controller/release.yaml) installed on management cluster.
- Service account to authenticate the TF-Controller.
- [AdminRoleBinding](./tf-controller/rolebinding.yaml) for TF-Controller.
- [Cluster template](./aws-eks.yaml) with Terraform object points to tf-modules. This can be changed according to your setup.
- Leaf cluster [terraform modules](./tf-modules/main.tf) (sync-secrets, flux, external-secrets) managed by [this](./tf-modules/main.tf) module.
- Github token for flux to be able to push files to the repo.

## Steps

1- Make your changes in the template according to your setup then add it to your cluster and make sure it's installed

```bash
➜ k get CAPITemplate
NAMESPACE   NAME      AGE
default     aws-eks   6h40m

```

2- Create a [service account](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/terraform/aws-eks/) with proper access to authenticate tf-controller on AWS. Follow [this](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes) guide for other providers.

3- Install TF-Controller on the management cluster by making a kustomization to point to its location

- Kustomization file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: tf-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 30s
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./eksctl-clusters/apps/tf-controller
  prune: true
  validation: client
```

- Helm Repo & Helm Release and make sure to replace with the proper role

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: tf-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1h0s
  url: https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: tf-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: tf-controller
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: tf-controller
      version: ">=0.9.3"
  interval: 1h0s
  releaseName: tf-controller
  targetNamespace: flux-system
  install:
    crds: Create
  upgrade:
    crds: CreateReplace
  values:
    replicaCount: 1
    concurrency: 24
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 2Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 400m
        memory: 64Mi
    caCertValidityDuration: 24h
    certRotationCheckFrequency: 30m
    image:
      tag: v0.13.1
    runner:
      image:
        repository: ghcr.io/rparmer/tf-runner
        tag: ubuntu-1669733504
      serviceAccount:
        annotations:
          eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::894516026745:role/leaf-tf-controller" # TODO: replace with your role
    awsPackage:
      install: true
      tag: v4.38.0-v1alpha11
```

- TF-Controller Role binding file

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tf-runner-admin
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tf-runner
    namespace: flux-system
```

3- Configure the leaf-terraform modules with your required values (modify github branch, tokens, ...)

4- Create a new cluster using the template we created before

5- Wait for tf-controller job to finish

**Note (To be fixed)**

- you may have the following error

```bash
│ The "for_each" map includes keys derived from resource attributes that cannot be determined until apply, and so Terraform cannot determine the full set of keys that will
│ identify the instances of this resource.
│
│ When working with unknown values in for_each, it's better to define the map keys statically in your configuration and place apply-time results only in the map values.
│
│ Alternatively, you could use the -target planning option to first apply only the resources that the for_each value depends on, and then apply a second time to fully converge.
╵
```

- This is because the flux-system have to be applied before flux installation

Temp fix using

```bash
➜  flux git:(add-flux) ✗ tf apply -var "github_token=$GITHUB_TOKEN" --target=kubernetes_namespace.flux_system                                                          <aws:sts>
kubernetes_namespace.flux_system: Refreshing state... [id=wge2205-leaf-flux-system]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

Then the job should be fixed
