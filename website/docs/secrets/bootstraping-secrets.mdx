# Overview

When accessing to protected resources there is a need for a client to authenticate before
the access is granted and the resource is consumed. For the authentication, a client presents
credentials that are either created manually or available through infrastructure a common scenario
is a secrets store.

Weave gitops allows you to provision the secret management infrastructure as part of [its capabilities](./setup-secrets-operator.mdx).
However, in order to provision the secret infrastructure, as any other application that has secrets, we
need to make the secret it needs to install it.

This type of initial secret is what we call it bootstrapping secret and this guide gives you
with the different alternatives that weave gitops gives you to achieve the task.

Bootstrapping secrets will be not only present while provision your secrets managmenet solution but in
any platform provisioning task that comes before you have avaialble before the secrets management solution
is availabe. Another common example is provisioning platform capabilities itself via
https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/cluster-management/getting-started/#profiles-and-clusters
that are stored in private repositories. For example https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/helmreleases/#helm-repository-authentication-with-credentials

To address this problem, weave gitops provides the following alternatives:

- SecretSync: to leverage weave gitops for secrets bootstrapping.
- Secrets Terraform Module: to leverage terraform and t for secrets bootstrapping.

## Using `SecretSync` Custom Resource
// Description on how SecretSync works and what it provides and its limitations, and maybe an example CR yaml
### Working with SecretSync
// Step by step guide to how to set it up to acheive bootstrapping a secret from management cluster to a new cluster called 'dev'


## Using Terraform and `tf-controller`
// Description on how the Terraform and tf-controller can be utilized to bootstrap secrets + Reference to the terraform module 
// This has to be focused only on the secrets module, not the other modules (cause we are in the context of secrets now)
### Working with Terraform and `tf-controller`
// Step by step guide + having the pre-requistes of having tf-controller set up
