This page helps you to understand the options available to configure Explorer

## Prerequisites
Before using Explorer, please ensure that:
- You have Weave Gitops Enterprise [v0.21.2](../../releases)

## Setup

Explorer is enabled via configuration through the feature flag  `enableExplorer` that you could
configure in your Weave Gitops Enterprise helm release values file

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... other spec components
  values:
    enableExplorer: true
```

## Configuration

### Clusters

Explorer watches the [GitopsClusters](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/#connect-a-cluster)
that you have connected to Weave Gitops Enterprise.

### Kinds

Explorer watches for the following kind resources out of the box:

- RBAC: ClusterRole, Role, ClusterRoleBinding and RoleBinding
- Flux Applications: Kustomizations, HelmRelease

## Data Layer

Explorer take a simple approach to manage resource views. It leverages a Data Store for caching the views and query them.
The storage lifecycle is bounded to Weave Gitops Enterprise app and does not provide persistence guarantees.
Instead, it requests data as required to the leaf clusters. In its simplest form, the data store used is [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html).

## Authentication and Authorization

There are two main paths to consider within Explorer in the context of authentication and authorization (authN/authZ):

1. The read or querying path is exercised when a weave gitops user queries the data.
2. The write or collecting path is exercised to gather the resources from the leaf clusters.

We look into them separately.

## Authentication and Authorization for querying

Explorer leverages existing authentication and authorization built-in the [application](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/configuration/securing-access-to-the-dashboard/).
It identifies for a user logged in the application: its identity and the access permissions via Kuberentes RBAC.
Query results are filtered honouring the access determined via RBAC.

## Authentication and Authorization for collecting

:::caution

**This feature is in alpha and certain aspects will change**

We're very excited for people to use this feature.
However, please note that some changes will be made to the security by implementing impersonation for more
fine-grained control over the collector.
:::


[GitopsClusters](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/#connect-a-cluster)
defines the connection and security context that Explorer leverages to collect data from leaf clusters.

Given that you have followed the indications to RBAC indications in the [documentation](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/configuration/service-account-permissions/).
To enable explorer to watch resources you need to add the following RBAC resources

Define a ClusterRole that allows watching

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: collector
rules:
  - apiGroups: [ "rbac.authorization.k8s.io" ]
    resources: [ "roles", "clusterroles", "rolebindings", "clusterrolebindings" ]
    verbs: [ "list", "watch" ]
  - apiGroups: [ "kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "list", "watch" ]
  - apiGroups: [ "helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "list", "watch" ]
  - apiGroups: [ "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories", "ocirepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "list", "watch" ]
```

If you want the collector to watch any namespace use a ClusterRoleBinding
```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: wge-collector
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <gitops-cluster-service-account-name> # service account name that your gitops cluster uses
    namespace: <gitops-cluster-service-account-namespace>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: collector
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

If you want the collector to watch a particular namespace use a `RoleBinding` instead

:::tip
It is recommended to add these RBAC resources as part of your [bases](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/getting-started/#add-common-rbac-to-the-repo)
