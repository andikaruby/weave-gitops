## Prerequisites

Before using Pipelines, please ensure that:

## Define a pipeline

A pipeline allows you to define the route your application is taking in order to make it to production.
There are three main concepts playing in a pipeline:
- the `application` to deliver
- the `environments` that your app will go through in its way to production (general)
- the `deployment targets` or the clusters that each environment has

You can define a delivery pipeline using a `Pipeline` custom resource.
An example of how it looks for an application `podinfo` is shown below.
