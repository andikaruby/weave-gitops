This page helps you to understand the options available to configure Explorer

## Prerequisites
Before using Explorer, please ensure that:
- You have Weave Gitops Enterprise [v0.21.0](../../releases)

## Setup

Explorer is enabled via configuration through the feature flag  `enableExplorer` that you could
configure in your Weave Gitops Enterprise helm release values file

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... other spec components
  values:
    enableExplorer: true
```

## Configuration

### Clusters

Explorer watches the [GitopsClusters](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/#connect-a-cluster)
that you have connected to Weave Gitops Enterprise.

### Kinds

Explorer watches for the following kind resources out of the box:

- RBAC: ClusterRole, Role, ClusterRoleBinding and RoleBinding
- Flux Applications: Kustomizations, HelmRelease

## Data Layer

Explorer take a simple approach to manage resource views. It leverages a data store for caching the views and query them.
The storage lifecycle is bounded to weave gitops enterprise and does not provide persistence guarantees.
Instead, it requests data as required to the leaf clusters. In its simplest form, the data store used is [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html).

## Security

There are two main security paths in the context of Explorer:

1. A read path exercised when a weave gitops user queries the data.
2. A write path that is executed to collect and store the data from the leaf clusters.

In terms of security they are having a set of considerations

## Security for the read path

For the read path, explorer leverages existing authentication and authorization built-in the [application](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/configuration/securing-access-to-the-dashboard/)
that identifies for a user logged in the application: its identity and the access permissions via Kuberentes RBAC.
Query results are filtered honouring the access determined via RBAC.

## Security for the write path

### Management Cluster

As mentioned earlier, [GitopsClusters](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/#connect-a-cluster)
defines the connection and security context that explorer will use to connect and watch leaf cluster resources.

### Leaf Cluster

Given that the gitopscluster defines an authentication context, that user in the leaf cluster needs to have the
permissions to watch the [supported kinds](#kinds). Apart from the RBAC [specified](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/#how-to-connect-a-cluster)

Access to the kinds should be allowed by the following rbac in the leaf clusters:
