<AlphaWarning/>

As platform engineer you could need to have a finer understanding on the underlying logic for Explorer. The following
options are available to you to operate and troubleshoot it.

## Debug Access Rules

It is a debugging tool to make visible explorer authorization logic. You could find it as tab `Access Rules`  alongside
the `Query` tab.

You could discover by `Cluster` and `Subject` the `Kinds` it is allowed to read. These are the rules that
will be the source of truth doing authorization when a user does a query.


## Monitoring

Explorer provides the following telemetry to use for operations.

### Metrics

Explorer exports [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics.

Configuration happens during releasing as shown below.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  values:
    #### Metrics - Prometheus metrics configuration
    metrics:
      # Enables metrics generation and prometheus endpoint
      enabled: false
      service:
        # -- Port to start the metrics exporter on
        port: 8080
        # -- Annotations to set on the service
        annotations:
          prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
          prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
          prometheus.io/port: "{{ .Values.metrics.service.port }}"
```

#### Querying

Based on [go-http-metrics](https://github.com/slok/go-http-metrics/blob/master/metrics/prometheus/prometheus.go), the following
metrics are generated.

**Request Duration:** histogram with the latency of the HTTP requests.

```
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/v1/query",method="POST",le="0.05"} 0
http_request_duration_seconds_sum{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 10.088081923
http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 51
```

**Response Size:** histogram with the size of the HTTP responses in bytes

```
http_response_size_bytes_bucket{handler="/v1/query",method="POST",le="0.05"} 10
http_response_size_bytes_sum{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 120
http_response_size_bytes_count{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 10
```

**Request In Flight:** gauge with the number of inflight requests being handled at the same time.

```
http_requests_inflight{handler="/v1/query"} 0
```

#### Collecting

The following metrics are available to monitor the collecting path

**Cluster Watcher Status**

The metric `collector_cluster_watcher` provides the status of the clusters that collector is watching with the following
labels:
- name: name of the cluster (ie: management)
- host: api server url  (ie: host="https://F97364D6B48F2fasdf64A0272CB4D349F.gr7.eu-north-1.eks.amazonaws.com/)
- kind: kind being watched (ie: "HelmRelease")
- status: cluster watcher status (ie: Started, Stopped)

```
collector_cluster_watcher{name, host, kind, status}
```

**Cluster Watcher Client**

The metric `rest_client_requests_total` is a counter that indicates the number of requests done to an api server with the
following dimensions:
- host: request url
- verb: request http verb
- code: http response code

```
rest_client_requests_total{host="https://127.0.0.1:64078/apis?timeout=32s",verb="GET"} 3
rest_client_requests_total{host="https://F97364D6B48F2600864A0272CB4D349F.gr7.eu-north-1.eks.amazonaws.com/apis/acme.cert-manager.io/v1?timeout=30s",verb="GET"} 2
```

### Dashboard

You could leverage [this grafana dashboard](./resources/dashboard.json) in Grafana to monitor its [golden signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)
