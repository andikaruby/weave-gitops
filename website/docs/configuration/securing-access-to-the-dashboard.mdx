title: Securing access to the dashboard

## Dashboard Login

There are 2 supported methods for logging in to the dashboard:
- [Login via an OIDC provider](../oidc-access)
- [Login via a cluster user account](../emergency-user) (not recommended)
- [Anonymous access](../anonymous-access) (to work with other external auth solutions)

The recommended method is to integrate with an OIDC provider,
as this will let you control permissions for existing users and groups that have
already been configured to use OIDC.

It is also possible to use the Emergency Cluster User Account to login, if an OIDC provider is not available to use.

Finally its also possible to disable authentication completely and allow anonymous access to the dashboard.
Alone this is not recommended, but can be used in conjunction with other external auth solutions.

All methods work with standard Kubernetes RBAC.
