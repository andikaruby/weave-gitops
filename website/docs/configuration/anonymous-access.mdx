title: Anonymous Access
---

:::danger Important
Alone, this is an **insecure** method of securing your dashboard.

It is designed to be used with other external authentication systems like auth proxies.
:::

## Configuring Anonymous access

Set the following values in the [Helm Chart](../references/helm-reference.md):

```yaml
#
additionalArgs:
- --insecure-no-authentication=gitops-test-user
#
```

The value of the `--insecure-no-authentication` flag is the
kubernetes `User` to be impersonated to make requests into the cluster.

When this flag is set all other authentication methods (e.g. those specified via `--auth-methods`) are disabled.

No login screen will be displayed when accessing the dashboard.

## User permissions

By default both a ClusterRole and Role are generated for the [emergency user](./emergency-user.mdx).

This makes it easy to test out the Anonymous access by setting the flag to the name of this user. (`gitops-test-user` by default)
A base set of permissions to access Flux resources will be pre-configured.
