## Requirements
- Weave Gitops Enterprise RBAC configuration for pipelines exists

## Define a delivery pipeline

A delivery pipeline allows you to define the route your application is taking in order to make it to production.
There are three main concepts playing in a delivery pipeline:
- the `application` to deliver
- the `environments` your delivery pipeline has and
- the `deployment targets` that each environment has

In weave gitops you could define a delivery pipeline using a `Pipeline` Custom Resource Definitions.
An example of how it looks for an application `search-svc` is shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: pipelines.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: search-svc
  namespace: search
spec:
  appRef:
    kind: HelmRelease
    name: search-svc
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
  environments:
    - name: dev
      targets:
        - namespace: search
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: test
      targets:
        - namespace: search
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: test
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: prod
      targets:
        - namespace: search
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: prod
            namespace: flux-system
```

search-svc gets delivered to the traditional delivery pipeline composed by `dev`, `test` and `production` environments, where
each of the environments are backed by a GitopsCluster deployment target.
