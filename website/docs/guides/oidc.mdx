title: Common OIDC provider configurations
---

This page provides guides for configuring Weave GitOps with the most common OIDC providers.

## Google

Google's identity provider does not support the groups scope which Weave GitOps requests by default. That's why in
this example the `customScopes` field is set to only request the `openid` and `email` scopes.

1. Obtain the client ID and secret by following the [official guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
   from Google.
1. Configure Weave GitOps:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
       name: oidc-auth
       namespace: WEAVE_GITOPS_NAMESPACE
   stringData:
       clientID: CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_1
       clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_1
       issuerURL: https://accounts.google.com
       redirectURL: BASE_WEAVE_GITOPS_URL/oauth2/callback
       customScopes: openid,email
   ```

## Azure AD

1. Obtain the client ID and secret by following the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
   from Microsoft.
1. [optional] Configure group claims by following this [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/configure-tokens-group-claims-app-roles).
1. Configure Weave GitOps:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
       name: oidc-auth
       namespace: WEAVE_GITOPS_NAMESPACE
   stringData:
       clientID: CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_1
       clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_1
       issuerURL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/v2.0
       redirectURL: BASE_WEAVE_GITOPS_URL/oauth2/callback
       customScopes: openid
       claimUsername: sub
   ```

## Keycloak

Keycloak is highly customizable so the steps to obtain client ID and secret will vary depending on your setup. The
general steps are very similar and the following steps point to the appropriate pages in the official Keycloak
documentation:

1. Log in to the Keycloak admin console and [create a realm](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-realms).
1. [Create a client application](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_resource_server_create_client)
   and choose "OpenID Connect" as the client type.
1. Make sure to set the "Client Authenticator" on the "Credentials" tab to "Client Id and Secret" and generate a secret.
1. Configure Weave GitOps:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
       name: oidc-auth
       namespace: WEAVE_GITOPS_NAMESPACE
   stringData:
       clientID: CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_2
       clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_3
       issuerURL: https://KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN/realms/KEYCLOAK_REALM
       redirectURL: BASE_WEAVE_GITOPS_URL/oauth2/callback
   ```
