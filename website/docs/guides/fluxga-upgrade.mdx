# Upgrade to Flux GA

We are very excited for the release of the [Flux GA!](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases)

This guide aims to answer some [common questions](#faq) before starting the upgrade, and provides step-by-step
instructions.

## Before Starting the Upgrade

Useful terms used in this guide:

- `Flux Beta or Flux v0.x` as the [latest Flux Beta Release](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2).
- `Flux GA` as the [latest Flux GA Release Candidate](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.3)
- `Weave GitOps` as the [latest Weave GitOps Enterprise release](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-enterprise/releases/latest)

## FAQ

Here you can find the most common questions around upgrading.

### Why Upgrade to Flux GA

Although Flux Beta APIs have been stable and used in production for quite some time, Flux GA is the main supported API version for new features and development. Features like [horizontal scaling](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/sharding/)
are only available in Flux GA. Also, beta APIs will be removed after six months.

### Can I Use Weave GitOps with Flux GA?

Yes. This has been possible since Weave Gitops v0.22.0. Use the [latest available release](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases) for the best experience.

### Can I Use Weave GitOps Enterprise with Flux GA?

Yes. This has been possible since Weave GitOps Enterprise v0.22.0. Use the [latest available release](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/enterprise/getting-started/releases-enterprise/) for the best experience.

The following limitations are knowns by version:

#### v0.23.0 onwards

No limitations

#### v0.22.0

If you are using GitOpsSets, upgrade that component to v0.10.0 for Flux GA compatibility.
Update the Weave GitOps Enterprise HelmRelease values to use the new version.

```yaml
gitopssets-controller:
  controllerManager:
    manager:
      image:
        tag: v0.10.0
```

### I am using Weave Gitops v0.22 (or later) with Flux Beta. What is the impact?

Latest Weave GitOps is compatible with Flux Beta, so no impact is expected.

### I am using Weave GitGps Enterprise v0.22 (or later) with Flux Beta. What is the impact?

Latest Weave GitOps Enterprise is compatible with Flux Beta, so no impact is expected.

### What is the support strategy and timelines?

Weave GitOps currently supports both Flux Beta and Flux GA v2.0.0 release candidates. It means that features,
bugs, and security patches are compatible with both API versions. We expect this to change once Flux GA v2.0.0 is released. At that moment only Flux GA will be fully supported. Flux Beta support will be deprecated, only releasing patches for CVEs impacting Weave GitOps for Flux Beta.

Looking to timelines, we expect Flux Beta deprecation right after Flux GA is released.

### When support for Flux Beta will be dropped?

Once Flux GA is released. A concrete date will be given after that event that we expect to be in the range of weeks
after the release.

### Will be able to use Flux Beta once Flux GA is released?

Plan upgrading to Flux GA using its release candidates train. If you are not able to, you can use Weave GitOps with Flux Beta, but you might find increasing limitations as new features are designed with Flux GA APIs in mind.

## Upgrade

:::info Note
_Flux GA release candidates have the same Kubernetes compatibility as Flux 0.41.2_
:::

:::info Hosted flux?
If you are using a hosted Flux version, please check with your provider if they support Flux GA before upgrading following this guide.
Known hosted Flux providers:

- EKS Anywhere
- [Azure AKS Flux-Gitops extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/extensions-release#flux-gitops)

As of writing they do not yet support the new version, so please wait before upgrading to Flux GA.
:::

Below, we'll take you through the multiple steps required to migrate to your system to Flux GA. After each step the cluster will be
in a working state, so you can take your time to complete the migration.

1. Upgrade to [latest Weave Gitops](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/enterprise/getting-started/releases-enterprise/)
2. Upgrade to Flux GA in `ClusterBootstrapConfig`s
3. Upgrade to Flux GA on your leaf clusters and management clusters
4. Upgrade GitopsTemplates, GitopsSets and ClusterBootstrapConfigs

### 1. Upgrade to latest WGE

Use your regular WGE upgrade procedure to bring it to the [latest version](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/enterprise/getting-started/releases-enterprise/)

:::warning upgrading to Flux GA with WGE v0.22.0?

Ensure that you address [this](#v0220)
:::

At this stage you have Weave GitOps running Flux Beta.

### 2. Upgrade to Flux GA in ClusterBootstrapConfigs

First, we ensure any new clusters are bootstrapped with Flux GA. Then we'll upgrade the existing clusters.

`ClusterBootstrapConfig` will most often contain an invocation of `flux bootstrap`. Make sure the image is using `v2`.

           name: flux-bootstrap
           ...
```
</details>

At this stage, your new bootstrapped clusters will run Flux GA.

### 3. Upgrade to Flux GA on your existing leaf clusters and management clusters

Follow the upgrade instructions from the [Flux v2.0.0-rc.1 release notes](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

At minimum, you'll need to rerun the `flux bootstrap` command on your leaf clusters and management clusters.

You'll also need to bump API versions in your manifests to `v1` as described in the Flux upgrade instructions:

> Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta
> versions will be removed after 6 months.

At this stage all clusters are running Flux GA.

### 4. Upgrade GitOpsTemplates, GitOpsSets, and ClusterBootstrapConfigs

Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually. We advise against delaying this procedure as the Beta versions will be removed after six months.

#### `GitOpsTemplate` and `CAPITemplate`

Update `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` CRs in the `spec.resourcetemplates` to `v1` as described in the flux upgrade instructions.

#### `GitOpsSets`

Update `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` CRs in the `spec.template` of your `GitOpsSet` resources to `v1` as described in the Flux upgrade instructions.

### 5. Future steps

At this stage all clusters are running Flux GA. This will allow you to seamlessly upgrade to the upcoming release of Weave GitOps that will drop support for Flux Beta.

If you have updated your `Kustomization` and `GitRepository` resources to `v1`, you can also upgrade to the future release of Flux that will drop support for `< v1` APIs.

:::info

Weave GitOps Enterprise 0.23.0 generates v1beta2 `Kustomization` Custom Resources when using the _Add app_ and _Cluster Template_ features. This is to support installations still using Flux Beta.

After upgrading to the release of Weave GitOps that drops support for Flux Beta, Weave GitOps Enterprise will create `v1` Resources.
However, you will have to manually update any `Kustomization` resources that have been created to `v1`.
