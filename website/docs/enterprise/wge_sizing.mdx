## Sizing Clusters for Weave GitOps Enterprise

Weave GitOps Enterprise can be platformed on top of any hardware, virtualized or physical, and run any
combination of CAPI providers to suit the provisioning needs of your environment.

We advise sizing the cluster relative to the criteria under which it will continuously operate.

| Management cluster topology              | Management cluster VM size                                                                             | Workload cluster capacity                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes | Control plane nodes: (CPU: 2 Memory: 4 GB Disk: 20 GB)  Worker nodes: (CPU: 2 Memory: 4 GB Disk: 20 GB)    | 5 workload clusters, each cluster deployed with 3 control plane and  3-200 worker nodes or 10 workload clusters, each cluster deployed with 3 control plane and 3-50 worker nodes  |
| 3 control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes | Control plane nodes: (CPU: 4 Memory: 16 GB Disk: 40 GB)  Worker nodes: (CPU: 4  Memory: 16 GB Disk: 40 GB) | One workload cluster, deployed with 3 control plane and 3-500 worker nodes                                                                                                         |
| 3 control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes | Control plane nodes: (CPU: 4 Memory: 16 GB Disk: 40 GB) Worker nodes:  (CPU: 4 Memory: 16 GB Disk: 40 GB)  | 200 workload clusters, each cluster deployed with 3 control plane and 3-5 worker nodes                                                                                             |

Whilst not a catchall for every use case (and in some you may prefer to run more that a single management cluster) we recommend that
production environments adhere to a sensible rule of thumb and monitor metrics to ensure that clusters exhibit performance which does not compromise/degrade
operations in the event of a network partition, unhealthy node etc.

Please reach out to customer support to discuss any specifics.
