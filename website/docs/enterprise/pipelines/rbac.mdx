# RBAC Configuration for  Pipelines<TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

This section provides a recommended way to configure RBAC for pipelines usage. It is oriented to the journey
that you expect your users to have.

## View pipelines

In order to view your pipelines, users would need to have read access to the underlying resources.

An example configuration to achieve this purpose could be seen below with `pipeline-reader` role and `search-pipeline-reader`
rolebinding to allow a group `search-developer` to access pipeline resources within `search` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pipelines-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [ "pipelines.weave.works" ]
    resources: [ "pipelines" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: search-pipeline-reader
  namespace: search
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: search-developer
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pipelines-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
