## Pipelines

As [Wikipedia defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)

>Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
>ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually.
>It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time,
>and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production.
>A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.


>Continuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline.
>The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.[12]

Weave Gitops Enterprise pipelines allows you to define your deployment pipelines to enable continous delivery for
your applications.

As part of Weave Gitops Enterprise, you could use

- [Define a delivery pipeline](../getting-started/#define-a-pipeline) that you want you application to follow
- [View a pipeline](../getting-started/#view-pipeline-list) and check the status of your deployments.

Now that you know what delivery pipelines could do for you, just [get started](../getting-started.md)
