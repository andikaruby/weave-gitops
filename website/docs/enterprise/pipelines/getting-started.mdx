# Getting started with pipelines <TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

## Requirements
- You have configured Weave Gitops Enterprise [RBAC for pipelines](./rbac.mdx)

## Define a pipeline

A delivery pipeline allows you to define the route your application is taking in order to make it to production.
There are three main concepts playing in a delivery pipeline:
- the `application` to deliver
- the `environments` your delivery pipeline has and
- the `deployment targets` that each environment has

In weave gitops you could define a delivery pipeline using a `Pipeline` Custom Resource Definitions.
An example of how it looks for an application `podinfo` is shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: pipelines.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: podinfo-02
  namespace: default
spec:
  appRef:
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    name: podinfo
  environments:
    - name: dev
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-dev
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: test
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-qa
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
        - namespace: podinfo-02-perf
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: prod
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-prod
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: prod
            namespace: flux-system
```

`podinfo` gets delivered to a traditional delivery pipeline composed by `dev`, `qa`, (`perf`) and `production` environments,
where each of the environments are backed by a `GitopsCluster` deployment target.

For more details about the spec of a pipeline CRD [see here](./pipeline-crd.mdx)

## View pipeline list

Once flux has created your pipeline you could navigate to the pipelines view to see it.

Pipeline list view show the list of pipeline you have access to, with a simplified experience to understand
the application type and environments that

## View a pipeline details

Once you have selected a pipeline for the pipeline list you will navigate to pipeline details view.
In pipeline details view you could view the current status of your application by environment and deployment
target.
