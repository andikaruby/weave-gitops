# Install Weave GitOps Enterprise via CLI

Weave GitOps Enterprise provides a streamlined method for its installation, employing the `gitops-ee bootstrap` command. This command acts as a wizard-like interface, simplifying the installation process by guiding users through each step of the configuration. For those seeking advanced customization, the flexibility to fine-tune the Weave GitOps Enterprise Helm release directly is also available.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with the installation process, please make sure the following pre-requisites are there and available. 

* Management Cluster, a kubernetes cluster with a kubeconfig that has admin permissions to be able to create resources.
* Git Repository to be used as the repository of the WeaveGitOps Enterprise repo. At this point, we require that you have ssh access to your git repository.
* Flux binary to be installed locally to be used in reconciling sources, Kustomizations, HelmReleases
* Flux installed on the Management cluster using `flux bootstrap`. 
:::info
Please follow flux guide here: [https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/)
:::

* Entitlment installed in the management cluster. 
:::info
To get the entitlement secret please contact *sales@weave.works*, then apply it on your management cluster with the name `weave-gitops-enterprise-credentials` under `flux-system` namespace. 
:::

## Getting Started

#### Install `gitops-ee` CLI (> v0.35)

Weave GitOps Enterprise Bootstrap functionality is available on Weave GitOps Enterprise CLI starting from version x.x.x. If you haven't already, please install the latest `gitops-ee` CLI using this command.
```bash
brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops-ee
```

#### Bootstrap Weave GitOps Enterprise
Please use the following command to start the installation wizard of Weave GitOps Enterprise.

```bash
gitops-ee bootstrap
```

The bootstrap wizard will take you step-by-step into configuring Weave GitOps Enterprise. To understand more about the CLI configurations experience, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations). 

## Understanding `gitops-ee bootstrap`

### Overview

`gitops-ee bootstrap` command is a wizard-like command line that helps you to install Weave GitOps Enterprise on their management cluster by guiding them step by step to configure it. 

The following are the steps the wizard will take you through it.

1. [Verifying Entitlement](#verifying-entitlement): Verify entitlement secret content (username, password, entitlement)
2. [Verifying flux](#verifying-flux): Verify flux installation on management cluster
4. [Selecting WGE version](#selecting-wge-version): from the latest 3 available releases
5. [Create admin credentials](#create-admin-credentials): create admin secret with username and password to be able to access the dashboard
6. [Select the domain](#select-the-domain): choose between 2 methods to access the dashboard either locally or via external domain
7. [Access the dashboard](#access-the-dashboard): via the link from the installation success message
8. (Optional) [Configure OIDC](#configure-oidc): to enable login to dashboard via OIDC providers.

### Verifying Entitlement

Weave GitOps Enterprise Entitlement is your obtained license to use our product. The entitlement file is a kubernetes secret that contains your licence. The bootstrap CLI will check if the entitlement manifest exists on the management cluster, and it will check if it has valid content and the entitlement is not expired. 
To get the entitlement secret please contact *sales@weave.works*, then apply it on your management cluster with the name `weave-gitops-enterprise-credentials` under `flux-system` namespace. 

### Verifying flux

Weave GitOps Enterprise runs on top of flux, the bootstrap CLI will check if flux is installed on the management cluster, and it will verify that it has the right version with valid git repository setup, and it is able to reconcile flux components properly. 
If flux is installed, but doesn't have a valid installation, the bootstrap CLI will terminate pending the fix or uninstall of current flux installation.
If flux is not installed at all, the bootstrap CLI offers the option to bootstrap flux. 

### Providing GitRepository Authentication
In order for `gitops-ee bootstrap` to push WGE resources to the management cluster's git repository, you will be prompted to provide the private key used to access your repo via ssh. If the private key is encrypted, you will also be asked to provide the private key password. 
:::info
Disclaimer: The bootstrap CLI will ONLY use the private key to push WGE resources to your repo, and won't use it in any other way that can comprimise your repo or clusters security. 
:::

### Selecting WGE version
The bootstrap CLI will prompt you to choose from the latest 3 versions of Weave GitOps Enterprise.

### Create admin credentials
You will be prompt to provide admin username and password, which will be used to access the dashboard. This will create admin secret with the credentials. If you already have previous admin credentials on your cluster, the installation will prompt you if you want to continue with the old credentials or exit and revoke them and re-run the installation.

### Select the domain
To access Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard, you have one of 2 options: 
##### via localhost
This requires no pre-requisites and more suitable for testing on your local or development environment, or air-gapped environments.


##### via External Domain
This is more suitable for production environments where multiple users are going to access the dashboard. However, this will require extrnal dns to be set up and configured for the domain to be accessible. 
:::tip
While there are multiple ways to setup and configure external dns. You can find a full example on how to setup it for multiple cloud providers [here](#external-dns)
:::

### Access the dashboard
After installation is successful. The CLI will print out the URL where you can access the dashboard.

### (Optional) Configure OIDC
OIDC configuration will enable you to login with OIDC provider beside, or instead of the admin credentials. Afte the installation is complete, you will be prompt if you want to configure OIDC access. If you don't want to set it up right away, you can do it later by running `gitops-ee bootstrap auth --type=oidc` command. 

To configure OIDC access, you will be asked to provide the following values: 
`DiscoveryUrl` this will verify that OIDC is accessible and get the issuerUrl from the OIDC settings.
`clientID` & `clientSecret` that you have configured on your OIDC static-clients.

:::note
Please don't forget to add a new static-client on your OIDC provider settings with the redirectURI `your-domain/oauth2/callback` for example `http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback`

## Appendix

### CLI configurations

- `--kube-config`:                  allows to choose the kubeconfig for your cluster, default would be ~/.kube/config

#### External DNS

[External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) for Kubernetes is a tool that automates the management of external DNS records.
It allows Kubernetes services to be exposed to the internet with a DNS entry that corresponds to the service's name.

There are several implementations of External DNS available with specific DNS providers (e.g., AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS, etc.).

Some popular implementations include:
- kube-dns: Integrates with CoreDNS and is a common choice for Kubernetes clusters.
- AWS Route 53 External DNS: Specifically for AWS Route 53.
- GCP External DNS: For Google Cloud DNS.
- Azure External DNS: For Azure DNS.

Learn how to deploy External DNS into your cluster [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns?tab=readme-ov-file#deploying-to-a-cluster)

[Full tutorial to use External DNS with AWS Route 53](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5/guide/integrations/external_dns/)

After configuring your provider to use ExternalDNS, The following example is a follow-up on the previous tutorial is the manifests that need to be deployed to the cluster with the following structure:
